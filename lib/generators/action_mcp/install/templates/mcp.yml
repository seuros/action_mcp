# Development environment
development:
  # Use simple pub/sub adapter for development
  adapter: simple
  
  # Session store examples for development
  # Use volatile client sessions for faster development
  # client_session_store_type: volatile
  # Use persistent server sessions to maintain state across restarts

  # min_threads: 5     # Minimum number of threads in the pool
  # max_threads: 10    # Maximum number of threads in the pool

# Test environment
test:
  # JWT authentication for testing environment
  authentication: ["jwt"]
  
  # Test adapter for testing
  adapter: test
  
  # Use volatile sessions for testing (fast cleanup)

# Production environment
production:
