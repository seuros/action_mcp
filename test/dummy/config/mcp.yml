# ActionMCP Configuration
# This file contains configuration for the ActionMCP server including
# authentication, profiles, and pub/sub system settings.

shared:
  # Authentication configuration - array of methods to try in order
  authentication: ["jwt", "none"]  # Try JWT first, fallback to none for dev

  # Session store configuration
  # Global session store type used by both client and server (default: volatile in dev/test, active_record in production)
  # session_store_type: volatile

  # Client-specific session store type (falls back to session_store_type if not specified)
  # client_session_store_type: volatile

  # Server-specific session store type (falls back to session_store_type if not specified)
  # server_session_store_type: active_record

  # Production session store configuration
  # Use persistent storage for production reliability
